# rpi-monitor
This simple script monitors the cpu temperature, core voltage and total voltage and their averages in realtime.

No setup is needed, just download the file and execute it like this:
```
$ python monitor.py
```

The first time you start it, it will prompt you if it should automatically create an alias in .bashrc so you
can launch it by only typing
```
$ monitor
```
the next time.
